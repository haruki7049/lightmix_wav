# lightmix-wav

A library to handle Wave file, which is used by my zig library, [lightmix](https://github.com/haruki7049/lightmix). However, [lightmix 0.14.0](https://github.com/haruki7049/lightmix/releases/tag/0.14.0) uses my zig wave library ([github.com/haruki7049/zigggwavvv](https://github.com/haruki7049/zigggwavvv)). Please also check `zigggwavvv`.

Simple, efficient wav decoding + encoding in Zig.

This module is forked from [github.com/veloscillator/zig-wav](https://github.com/veloscillator/zig-wav).
